# FlipClock
An Arduino-based graphical “flip clock”. Bonus faces because there’s room.

Inspired by a nice 320x480 colour LCD shield (ILI948x driver) and the realisation that an image tilted at 45 degrees could be approximated by omitting every 4th row.

The main clock display is the day, date and month in smallish flip-style digits across the top of the LCD (landscape mode).  The time is in big digits across the bottom. As a bonus, across the middle there’s a blinking/flipping colon and also an optional coloured digit indicating the number of days until I need to put out either the rubbish bin (red) or the recycling (yellow).

The LCD inspired me to add in some additional clock “faces”:

*CubeClock*

The LCD colours are appealing, so I experiment with coloured cubes. The look is based on this font www.dafont.com/kubics-rube.font

*Triangle Clock*

An adaptation of an eariler project with a triangulated irregular network (TIN) style face, more pretty colours.

*PongClock*

There was a little program memory left, so I squeezed in a very simple Pong Clock, again using code from an earlier project.
